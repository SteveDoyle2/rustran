Rustran!

THe goal of this is a Rust-based Nastran library with bindings for:
 - Python

It probably has to interface with numpy arrays in order to be fast, but it would be nice to be semi-compatible with pyNastran as well. Given pyNastran works well for binary files, this library is focused on the input deck (BDF/DAT) files.
